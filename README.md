# QR Code Generator Using Python

This project is a QR Code generator written in Python, utilizing the `qrcode` and `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) libraries. The code operates through a console interface where the user can input a link to be converted into a QR Code.

## How to Use

1. **Install the necessary libraries**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install qrcode
   ```
   ```sh
   pip install pillow
   ```

2. **Run the code**:
   Execute the script in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the link**:
   Follow the console prompts to enter the link you want to convert into a QR Code.

## Example

When prompted, enter a URL like this:
```
Please enter the URL to generate a QR Code: https://www.insertyourlink.com
```

The script will generate a QR Code image and save it as `QrCodeImage.png`.
